# Github API App
A simple python program which uses the Github API to do things.
The projects is made to gain more experience with the Github API and to start looking 
into the use of Poetry to better manage projects and dependencies.

This is a CLI project but might be updated to use Flask in the future (also to gain XP).

## Setup
1. Install Poetry
2. Create a Virtual Environement and Activate it
3. Run `Poetry install` to install all the required dependencies

You can now run the project.
