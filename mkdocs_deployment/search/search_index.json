Flask has been chosen because of its simplicity and flexibility. In addition to this, Flask is widely used across ONS and therefore has a strong support network if needed. Other web frameworks such as Django were considered, however Flask was decided upon because of the project's small size and the speed at which the proof of concept needed to be developed.</p>"},{"location":"#architecture-overview","title":"Architecture Overview","text":"<p>This project uses 4 major components:</p> <ul> <li>The App</li> <li>Data Retrieval</li> <li>The Storage Interface</li> <li>The GitHub API Toolkit (stored in another repository - Repository Link)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#the-app","title":"The App","text":"<p>This component is responsible for the majority of the Flask App. It contains all of the routing and UI processes. It also retrieves information using the other 3 components. The App uses the data retrieval component when finding the initial list of repositories, the storage interface when reading and writing data to S3 and the GitHub API toolkit when making direct calls to the GitHub API.</p>"},{"location":"#data-retrieval","title":"Data Retrieval","text":"<p>This component is used to get repository information from GitHub. The component uses the GitHub API Toolkit to make these requests. Data retrieval has 2 main processes, one for getting a list of repositories and one for contributors to a repository. Data Retrieval acts as a middle ground between <code>app.py</code> and the toolkit as the logic is too big and complex to be held around the UI and Flask functionality (increasing code readability).</p>"},{"location":"#the-storage-interface","title":"The Storage Interface","text":"<p>This component deals with any interaction the app has with both local and cloud storage, as well as making sure the local files match their AWS counterparts. All storage interactions the tool has works by making changes to local files, then uploading those to S3. If those local files do not exist or are outdated by another instance, they're downloaded from S3. This reduces the number of times changes are made to S3 as the local files are only uploaded once a bulk of actions has taken place (i.e when archiving repositories, instead of changing the S3 file for each repository, all changes are made locally then the S3 file is changed once).</p>"},{"location":"#the-github-api-toolkit","title":"The GitHub API Toolkit","text":"<p>This component is an imported library which is shared across multiple GitHub tools. The toolkit allows applications to make authenticated requests to the GitHub API. It is imported and used in the Lambda function.</p>"},{"location":"#high-level-data-overview","title":"High Level Data Overview","text":"<p>The app's dataset can be divided into 3 parts:</p> <ul> <li>Repositories Ready for Archive</li> <li>Archived Repositories</li> <li>Recently Added Repositories</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#repositories-ready-for-archive","title":"Repositories Ready for Archive","text":"<p>This section of the dataset gets stored in <code>repositories.json</code>.
